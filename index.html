    Hello everyone! Welcome to my page!
    Here's a little information about me and my projects.
    <h1>Education:</h1>
    <p>I completed high school at Danforth Collegiate Technical Insitutute, here in Toronto. 
        Then I headed to London, Ontario for university. I went to Western University for undergrad.
        I did my Honours Specialization in Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences. 
        After completion, I returned back to Toronto for grad school.

        The logo for my department, IHPME, is as follows:<br/>

        <br/>
        I learned that I need to click on "copy as path" to instruct HTML how to locate the image on my desktop. 
        And the br code tells it to go to the next line. Cool stuff.
